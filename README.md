# Codex for Sublime Text

This package won't work unless you have an OpenAI API key. If you'd like to use Codex, you need an API key that has Codex enabled.

First go to `Preferences > Codex > Codex Settings` and add your API key.

Then, place your cursor where you'd like to generate or highlight one or more regions you'd like to include in the prompt and press `CTRL+\`.

If you've highlighted multiple regions, the generation will be after either the last highlighted block or a cursor (if you've placed one somewhere not next to a highlighted region).
